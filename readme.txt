This plugin allows you to protect your WordPress content with a password and share access to it through encrypted links.

== Description ==

Password Protection with Shareable Links is a WordPress plugin designed to enhance the security of your content. With Password Protection with Shareable Links, you can protect any post, page, or custom content type with a password. Additionally, the plugin generates encrypted links that provide direct access to your protected content, bypassing the need for manual password entry.

To ensure functionality and security, the plugin disables caching on protected content, making sure the password gate displays correctly and updated content is served as expected.

Key Features:
- The wp-admin page is not protected and remains accessible for login at all times.
- Logged-in admins can always view all normal pages without restrictions.
- Feed access is also restricted, aligning with the intention to prevent unauthorized external access to the site's content.

For a hands-on test of the plugin, visit the [test installation](https://password-protection-shareable-links.plugiplugi.com/) (password: `1234`). Alternatively, access a protected page directly with a shareable link: [Direct Access Link](https://password-protection-shareable-links.plugiplugi.com/2024/10/25/hello-world/?password=UGxmb1l4NlJoWEM2dFJ3aEZ5Y0wrUT09) (Please use incognito mode or clear cookies if the password was previously entered).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `password-protection-shareable-links` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install the plugin directly through the WordPress plugins screen.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
